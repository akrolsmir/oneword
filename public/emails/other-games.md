<!-- Two other party games (by the makers of One Word) -->

Hi [[data:firstname:"friend"]],

Hope you've been enjoying One Word so far.  
Did you know that we've made other games as well? Check them out:

### [Listorama](https://oneword.games/listorama)

Listorama is a race to come up with the perfect list.  
For a particular category (e.g. "Kinds of candy"), you might have to:

- Find four examples that nobody else will pick _(Forgotten Four)_
- Think of the three most popular answers _(Threefold)_
- Match exactly one other player _(One on One)_

If you like trivia and outwitting your friends, you'll love Listorama!

### [Incrypt](https://oneword.games/incrypt)

Incrypt is a showdown between two teams: Red and Blue.

- The Red spy will use her team's four keywords to encode a message.
- If she's too clever, Red team may not understand the message...
- But if she's too obvious, Blue team will intercept it!

Perfect for fans of Codenames~

Try these out with your friends, and let me know what you think!  
Austin

P.S. Stay tuned -- we've got a couple MORE new games, coming soon ðŸ˜‰
