<!-- 3 tips for hosting a One Word game -->

Hi Lawrence,

Saw that you played through your first [One Word](https://oneword.games) game -- hope you had fun!  
I wanted to teach you about three of our favorite features, for when you host  
your next game :)

1. After you make a room, you'll start with words from the "Nouns" wordlist.  
   Nouns are great for new players... but if you're looking for a challenge, try  
   "Adjectives", "Verbs", or "Compounds" for your next game. These are a lot harder!

2. You can even upload your own favorite words as a _custom_ wordlist!  
   For example, Harrison (one of our [Supporters](https://oneword.games/supporter)) created  
   [this Harry Potter-themed list](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/akrolsmir/41e2aaacd0287f5420782d04a1cc42ba/raw/34d1149928f8dea61269f03cd5baab01e9708593/harry-potter.txt) for his weekly meetup.

3. Do your friends take a long time to think? Turn up the pressure  
   with our game timers! I'd recommend 60 seconds for clueing and guessing,  
   but you can always go longer or shorter.

Here's a quick screencast on how to set up a new game using these options:

Let me know if you have any questions; otherwise, happy cluing!
