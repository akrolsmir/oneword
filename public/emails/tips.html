<!-- 3 tips for hosting a One Word game -->
<p>Hi [[data:firstname:"friend"]],</p>
<p>
  Saw that you played through your first
  <a href="https://oneword.games">One Word</a> game -- hope you had fun!<br />I
  wanted to teach you about three of our favorite features, for when you host<br />your
  next game :)
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      After you make a room, you'll start with words from the &quot;Nouns&quot;
      wordlist.<br />Nouns are great for new players... but if you&#39;re
      looking for a challenge, try<br />&quot;Adjectives&quot;,
      &quot;Verbs&quot;, or &quot;Compounds&quot; for your next game. These are
      a lot harder!
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      You can even upload your own favorite words as a
      <em>custom</em> wordlist!<br />
      For example, Harrison (one of our
      <a href="https://oneword.games/supporter">Supporters</a>) created<br />
      <a
        href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/akrolsmir/41e2aaacd0287f5420782d04a1cc42ba/raw/34d1149928f8dea61269f03cd5baab01e9708593/harry-potter.txt"
        >this Harry Potter-themed list</a
      >
      for his weekly meetup.
    </p>
  </li>

    <p>
      Do your friends take a long time to think? Turn up the pressure<br />with
      our game timers! I&#39;d recommend 60 seconds for clueing and guessing,<br />but
      you can always go longer or shorter.
    </p>

</ol>

  Here&#39;s a quick screencast on how to set up a new game using these options:
