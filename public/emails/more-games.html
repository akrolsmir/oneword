<!-- Storytime and Pairwise: Two creative party games! -->
<p>Hi [[data:firstname:&quot;friend&quot;]],</p>
<p>
  Have you heard about two of One Word&#39;s newest games?<br />Bring them to
  your next game night:
</p>

</h3>
<p>
  Storytime is a storytelling game (as you probably guessed).<br />From a
  starting prompt:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Write a paragraph about what you think should happen next</li>
  <li>Try to use as many of the Bonus Words as possible!</li>
  <li>
    Vote for which paragraph you liked the best --<br />the winning entry
    becomes the new story
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Then rinse and repeat! Great for aspiring writers,<br />or anyone with a funny
  bone~
</p>
<h3 id="-pairwise-https-oneword-games-pairwise-">
  <a href="https://oneword.games/pairwise">Pairwise</a>
</h3>
<p>
  Pairwise is a creative exercise in finding connections between<br />two
  unlikely word pairs. Like Dixit meets Madlibs!
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Start by describing the word pair you see.<br />Don&#39;t be too vague or
    too obvious!
  </li>
  <li>Everyone creates a word pair to match than description...</li>
  <li>Then competes to see if they can pick out the original</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks as always for playing üôè<br />Austin</p>
