            <p>
              Super excited to announce a new game for you to try out: Quad
              Squad! What&#39;s special about this game is that it&#39;s a
              collaborative project with a couple of our favorite people in the
              board game industry: Chris &amp; Suzanne Zinsli of
              <a href="https://cardboardedison.com/">Cardboard Edison</a>. The
              result is a game we think you&#39;ll love üòÅ
            </p>

            <p>
              In Quad Squad, your goal is to come up with hard-to-classify
              prompts that send your friends to the four corners of an
              ever-changing quadrant chart. The more you get the other players
              to disagree, the better!
            </p>
            <p>
              So gather your virtual friends, log in, and get ready to cleverly
              categorize the world in less-than-obvious ways!
