<p>Hey Alex!</p>
<p>
  Hope you&#39;ve been enjoying the summer weather by day, and board games by
  night. Here&#39;s the latest on One Word!
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>üé≤ Make <em>your own</em> online board game</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you&#39;re interested in game design, but aren&#39;t a code ninja...
      then the <a href="https://oneword.games/platform">One Word Platform</a> is
      for you!<br />We&#39;re opening up the tech that powers One Word, and
      making it accessible so that anyone can create online games.<br />It&#39;s
      still in the early stages, but
      <a href="https://oneword.games/platform">sign up here</a> and you&#39;ll
      be the first to get access.

    <p><strong>üîñ Pairwise &amp; Storytime</strong></p>
    <p>
      If you haven&#39;t played in a while (or are looking for a change of
      pace), try out two of our newest games:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://oneword.games/pairwise">Pairwise</a> - a creative
        exercise in finding connections between two unlikely word pairs. Like
        Dixit meets Madlibs!
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://oneword.games/storytime">Storytime</a> - a storytelling
        game, great for aspiring writers -- or anyone with a funny bone!
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>üåè One Word now supports Chinese</strong></p>
    <p>
      That&#39;s right, you can now play One Word in foreign languages! (Well,
      one foreign language... for now.)<br />Huge shoutout to Joanne Yu, our
      Chinese translator and localization expert, who made this all possible.<br />By
      the way, we&#39;re seeking translators! If you know another language and
      want to help, email me at austin@oneword.games.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for playing,<br />Austin</p>
<p>
  P.S. Every Monday at 6pm PST, we run Game Night
  <a href="https://discord.gg/AP7ssVPPCr">on Discord</a>; come to meet friends
  and test our latest creations!
