### Summary

In Quad Squad, your goal is to come up with hard-to-classify prompts that send your friends to the four corners of an ever-changing quadrant chart. The more you get the other players to disagree, the better!

So gather your virtual friends, log in, and get ready to cleverly categorize the world in less-than-obvious ways!
