<!-- One Word's Game Builder is now in Early Access! -->

Hi there,

Thanks for your interest in One Word's Game Builder!
I'm excited to share the very first prototype of our Builder with you.
Check it out here: https://oneword.games/builder

Right now, what's supported:

- Build game layouts in a drag and drop interface
- Program simple game logic in Javascript
- Playtest and debug your creation

Over the next coming weeks, we'll be adding more features:

- Publish your game for anyone to play online
- Undo/redo support
- More game templates, components, and word lists

Things are still _super_ rough, but we really want to hear
your questions and feedback - just reply to this email,
or join us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/AP7ssVPPCr)!

Best,  
Austin
