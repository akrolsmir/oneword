<!-- One Word's Game Builder is now in Early Access! -->

Hi there,

Today, we're launching our Game Builder prototype to a small group of creators (including you!) Check it out at https://oneword.games/builder üòÅ

Right now, what's supported:

- Build game layouts in a drag and drop interface
- Program simple game logic in Javascript
- Playtest and debug your creation

And here's what we're working on, over the next few weeks:

- Publish your game for anyone to play online
- Undo/redo support
- More game templates, components, and word lists

Things are still _super_ rough, so any questions or feedback would be
really valuable - just reply to this email,
or join us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/AP7ssVPPCr)!

Best,  
Austin
