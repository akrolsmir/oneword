Hey Alex!

Hope you've been enjoying the summer weather by day, and board games by night. Here's the latest on One Word!

1. **üé≤ Make _your own_ online board game**

   If you're interested in game design, but aren't a code ninja... then the [One Word Platform](https://oneword.games/platform) is for you!  
   We're opening up the tech that powers One Word, and making it accessible so that anyone can create online games.  
   It's still in the early stages, but [sign up here](https://oneword.games/platform) and you'll be the first to get access.

2. **üîñ Pairwise & Storytime**

   If you haven't played in a while (or are looking for a change of pace), try out two of our newest games:

   - [Pairwise](https://oneword.games/pairwise) - a creative exercise in finding connections between two unlikely word pairs. Like Dixit meets Madlibs!
   - [Storytime](https://oneword.games/storytime) - a storytelling game, great for aspiring writers -- or anyone with a funny bone!

3. **üåè One Word now supports Chinese**

   That's right, you can now play One Word in foreign languages! (Well, one foreign language... for now.)  
   Huge shoutout to Joanne Yu, our Chinese translator and localization expert, who made this all possible.  
   By the way, we're seeking translators! If you know another language and want to help, email me at austin@oneword.games.

Thanks for playing,  
Austin

P.S. Every Monday at 6pm PST, we run Game Night [on Discord](https://discord.gg/AP7ssVPPCr); come to meet friends and test our latest creations!
