<!-- Storytime and Pairwise: Two creative party games! -->

Hi [[data:firstname:"friend"]],

Have you heard about two of One Word's newest games?  
Bring them to your next game night:

### [Storytime](https://oneword.games/storytime)

Storytime is a storytelling game (as you probably guessed).  
From a starting prompt:

- Write a paragraph about what you think should happen next
- Try to use as many of the Bonus Words as possible!
- Vote for which paragraph you liked the best --  
  the winning entry becomes the new story

Then rinse and repeat! Great for aspiring writers,  
or anyone with a funny bone~

### [Pairwise](https://oneword.games/pairwise)

Pairwise is a creative exercise in finding connections between  
two unlikely word pairs. Like Dixit meets Madlibs!

- Start by describing the word pair you see.  
  Don't be too vague or too obvious!
- Everyone creates a word pair to match than description...
- Then competes to see if they can pick out the original

Thanks as always for playing üôè  
Austin
