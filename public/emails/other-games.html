<!-- Two other party games (by the makers of One Word) -->
<p>Hi [[data:firstname:&quot;friend&quot;]],</p>
<p>
  Hope you&#39;ve been enjoying One Word so far.<br />Did you know that
  we&#39;ve made other games as well? Check them out:
</p>
<h3 id="-listorama-https-oneword-games-listorama-">
  <a href="https://oneword.games/listorama">Listorama</a>
</h3>
<p>
  Listorama is a race to come up with the perfect list.<br />For a particular
  category (e.g. &quot;Kinds of candy&quot;), you might have to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Find four examples that nobody else will pick <em>(Forgotten Four)</em>
  </li>
  <li>Think of the three most popular answers <em>(Threefold)</em></li>
  <li>Match exactly one other player <em>(One on One)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you like trivia and outwitting your friends, you&#39;ll love Listorama!
</p>
<h3 id="-incrypt-https-oneword-games-incrypt-">
  <a href="https://oneword.games/incrypt">Incrypt</a>
</h3>
<p>Incrypt is a showdown between two teams: Red and Blue.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The Red spy will use her team&#39;s four keywords to encode a message.
  </li>
  <li>If she&#39;s too clever, Red team may not understand the message...</li>
  <li>But if she&#39;s too obvious, Blue team will intercept it!</li>
</ul>
<p>Perfect for fans of Codenames~</p>
<p>
  Try these out with your friends, and let me know what you think!<br />Austin
</p>
<p>P.S. Stay tuned -- we&#39;ve got a couple MORE new games, coming soon ðŸ˜‰</p>
